# RAGnar

**RAGnar** is an interactive chatbot application that leverages **GPT-4o-mini** and **FAISS** for PDF-based knowledge retrieval, **SentenceTransformers** for embedding generation, and a user-friendly interface built using **PyQt5**. This project is named in memory of **Ragnar**, a playful and brave German shepherd who loved to bark and eat meat sticks.
